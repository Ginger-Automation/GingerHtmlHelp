Behavior-Driven Development addresses this problem ","\n      by showing you how to test, focusing on testing behavior, and not implementation","\n  ","What is Gherkin Language?","\n      Gherkin is a line-oriented language that uses indentation to define structure. Line endings terminate statements (called steps) and either spaces or tabs may be used for indentation. ","\n      (We suggest you use TABS for portability.) ","\n      Finally, most lines in Gherkin start with a special keyword: (more details in section: 5) Key Words include (Feature, Scenario, Given, And, Then, When, But)","\n      ","\n  ","Seamless integration from BDD Gherkin to Ginger Automation","\n      The Ginger Automation tool now can allow users to write scenarios and Ginger will seamlessly turn these scenarios into Automation Activities.","\n  ","\n      ","Gherkin – Introduction","\n         1.
