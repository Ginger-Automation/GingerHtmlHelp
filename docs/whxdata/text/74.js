We would tell Ginger to Automate a specific window by using it’s window name as its identity. Thus we refer to the window to ","\n              automate by using its window name and switching to that window before performing any other actions on it.","\n  ","          a.    Understanding the Ginger Window Explorer","\n                      The button next to the Agent connection information displays Ginger’s Window Explorer.","\n                      ","\n  "," ","\n  ","                 ","\n  ","                Adding Switch Window Action -","\n  ","                First, select the window which we need to Automate from the Ginger Window Explorer.","\n                     ","\n  ","                Note that the selection was done manually in this case.","\n                      To do this at run time, we need a Switch Window Action with the window name as a parameter.","\n                      Click on the "," button to create the activity and add it to the business flow with a single click.","\n  ","                 ","\n  ","\n                      As we proceed further with creating the actions for the automation, keep an eye on the “Activity Actions” section, where these actions will be added ","\n                      one by one as soon as we add them.","\n  ","                For now, we can see only the action that we’ve added, i.e. the switch window action:","\n                       ","\n  ","                Spying Elements","\n                      The   button in the Ginger Window Explorer allows the user to spy on the elements.","\n  ","                Click on the button once to activate the spy.","\n                      (the icon becomes   when activated)","\n  ","                Click on it again to deactivate.","\n                      (the icon becomes   when deactivated)","\n  ","                Now, activate the live spy through the Live Spy ( ) button.","\n                          ","\n  ","\n                      On the windows application, hover over the area you need to perform an action and press and hold control button on the keyboard.","\n  ","                Suppose if we want to click on the   button in Skype, we hover on that button while keeping the control key pressed. A red border over the element will ","\n                      confirm the element that is being spied.","\n                       ","\n  ","\n                      At this point, the Ginger Window Explorer would look like this:","\n                     ","\n  ","                There are 2 sections of the Ginger Window Explorer that we require to check:","\n                          1.    Actions","\n                          2.    Locators","\n  ","                ","The Actions section: ","This section shows the actions that we can perform on that specific element. Since it is a button, in this case, we can only perform “Click” ","\n                      and “Double Click” operations.","\n  ","                ","The Locators section:"," This section will show the different locators that we can use to identify the element.

For a button, this is not required, so we will skip that part.","\n  ","                 Once we have selected the Action and a Locator, we can click on the   button to test it.","\n                      (In case it fails, test again with a different locator/action)","\n  ","                The test result will be displayed as follows.
