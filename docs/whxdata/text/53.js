In such cases, we advise the users to ","\n              manually configure the obsolete action causing issue like mapping of values – Locate Value, Column Number or Column Title etc. ","\n              from the old action with the new UIElement Action.","\n  ","    b)    If the users still face issues with the converter beyond their control, they are requested to share the scenarios with the ","\n                 Ginger Core Team.  They can then look into it and fix it as soon as possible to make the converter more robust and intuitive. ","\n                 Feedback and suggestions are also welcome.","\n  ","    c)    It is recommended to choose a New Activity in Conversion Configurations section to add the newly converted actions.","\n\n"],"2":["How to use the Actions Converter?"],"id":"53"})
