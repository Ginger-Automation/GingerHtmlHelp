  <h1>How to use the Actions Convertor?</h1>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">As you can see below, &quot;Actions Conversion&quot; button is available in the Business Flow section of the Automate tab.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;"> <img src="../../../../assets/images/image649.png" /></span><span style="font-size:17px;"></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">                Figure 2 – Actions Conversion button</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;"><br />
      Please follow the steps mentioned below: </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">  a. Open your ASCF Business Flow in the Automate tab.<br />
           For example, we have created a sample ASCF Business Flow, TestBFlow, containing two activities viz. 1. Automate Selenium Web.<br />
           Now as you can see below, the first activity consists of non-platform based actions and the second one consists of ASCF actions,</span></p>
  <p>     <img src="../../../../assets/images/image650.png" /></p>
  <p>    <img src="../../../../assets/images/image651.png" /></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">          Figure 3 &amp; 4 – Displaying old ASCF Flow, TestBFlow</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">  b. Click on ‘Actions Conversion’ button on the tab.<br />
           On clicking the button, the following window will open up enlisting all the activities present in the respective business flow, <br />
           <img src="../../../../assets/images/image652.png" /><br />
           Figure 5 – Actions Conversion window showing activities in TestBFlow</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">     Now in this example, Action Conversion wizard will be opened and will display the activities which contains legacy actions.<br />
           <img src="../../../../assets/images/image653.png" /><br />
           Figure 6</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;"><br />
        c. Now we can select the activities which we want to convert to new actions and click on Next button, we will see a list of <br />
           Convertible Actions Types along with their count listed next to their Source Activities and Target Action Type, which states the <br />
           Action Type to which the old action will be converted to, after the conversion is completed.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">     <img src="../../../../assets/images/image654.png" /><br />
           Figure 7</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">     As you can see above, the selected activity consists of:</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">     •    1 Goto URL Action and,<br />
           •    6 Generic Element Actions</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">    These are the obsolete actions that will be converted to UIElement Actions that once configured with Java-platform based TA will be executed.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">  d. Now, we need to select the type of actions that we want to convert. We can also select all the enlisted Source Action Types too, <br />
           the selections can be made depending on requirement.<br />
           After selection the Source Action Type, we need to decide the conversion configuration. <br />
           This means that we need to decide whether we want to add newly converted action(s) to a New Activity or to the Same Activity along  with <br />
           the TA from the dropdown list.<br />
           Let’s consider both the scenarios separately here,</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;"><br />
      <strong>1. New Activity with selected Target Application from dropdown list</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">   In our example, we can select Web-App (or any other from dropdown) Target Application from the list and then, hit the Finish button, a new <br />
         activity with the name, New - Automate Selenium Web, will be added to your business flow just below the parent activity.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">   <img src="../../../../assets/images/image655.png" /><br />
         Figure 8</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">    We can notice that the old activity has been marked as Inactive and the newly converted activity has been set as Active.<br />
          <br />
      <strong>2. Same Activity with selected Target Application from dropdown list</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">   Now, if we select Menu Item Action and will take the default Target Application as for the Target Application for selected activity from the <br />
         list and then, hit the Convert button, we will see that the newly converted Menu Item actions will be added to the same activity <br />
         i.e. 2. Create Contact - Mandatory Information.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">  <img src="../../../../assets/images/image656.png" /><br />
       <br />
         Figure 9</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">   As we can see below that the newly converted Menu Item action into UIElement actions have been added right below the source action in the same <br />
         activity. Also the source actions have been marked as Inactive and the new UIElement actions have been set as Active.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">  <img src="../../../../assets/images/image657.png" /><br />
         Figure 10</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;"><strong>3. Action conversion to use the POM object</strong><br />
         As we can see below that, if we select the POM object to convert the legacy actions to use the POM object then we need to select the <br />
         Menu Item Action as in the figure below, by selecting this we can convert the selected actions to be converted to new actions which uses the <br />
         selected POM object. It tries to search the element (control in action) in the POM object and binds the new action with the element searched.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">   <img src="../../../../assets/images/image658.png" /><br />
         Figure 11</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;"><br />
        <img src="../../../../assets/images/image659.png" /><br />
         Figure 12</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;"><strong>4.    Some troubleshooting tips</strong><br />
          a)    The Actions Convertor has been tested against a number of ASCF Driver-based scenarios, with different business flows from different <br />
              projects but there could be some edge-cases, where it may encounter issues while conversion. In such cases, we advise the users to <br />
              manually configure the obsolete action causing issue like mapping of values – Locate Value, Column Number or Column Title etc. <br />
              from the old action with the new UIElement Action.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">    b)    If the users still face issues with the convertor beyond their control, they are requested to share the scenarios with the <br />
              Ginger Core Team so that they can look into it and fix it, as soon as possible to make the convertor more robust and intuitive. <br />
              Their feedback and suggestions are also welcome.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size:17px;">    c)    It is recommended to choose a New Activity in Conversion Configurations section to add the newly converted actions.</span></p>
