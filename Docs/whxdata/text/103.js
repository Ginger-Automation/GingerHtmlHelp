Open your ASCF Business Flow in the Automate tab.","\n           For example, we have created a sample ASCF Business Flow, TestBFlow, containing two activities viz. 1. Automate Selenium Web.","\n           Now as you can see below, the first activity consists of non-platform based actions and the second one consists of ASCF actions,","\n  ","     ","\n  ","    ","\n  ","          Figure 3 & 4 – Displaying old ASCF Flow, TestBFlow","\n  ","  b. Click on ‘Actions Conversion’ button on the tab.","\n           On clicking the button, the following window will open up enlisting all the activities present in the respective business flow, ","\n           ","\n           Figure 5 – Actions Conversion window showing activities in TestBFlow","\n  ","     Now in this example, Action Conversion wizard will be opened and will display the activities which contains legacy actions.","\n           ","\n           Figure 6","\n  ","\n        c. Now we can select the activities which we want to convert to new actions and click on Next button, we will see a list of ","\n           Convertible Actions Types along with their count listed next to their Source Activities and Target Action Type, which states the ","\n           Action Type to which the old action will be converted to, after the conversion is completed.","\n  ","     ","\n           Figure 7","\n  ","     As you can see above, the selected activity consists of:","\n  ","     •    1 Goto URL Action and,","\n           •    6 Generic Element Actions","\n  ","    These are the obsolete actions that will be converted to UIElement Actions that once configured with Java-platform based TA will be executed.","\n  ","  d. Now, we need to select the type of actions that we want to convert. We can also select all the enlisted Source Action Types too, ","\n           the selections can be made depending on requirement.","\n           After selection the Source Action Type, we need to decide the conversion configuration. ","\n           This means that we need to decide whether we want to add newly converted action(s) to a New Activity or to the Same Activity along  with ","\n           the TA from the dropdown list.","\n           Let’s consider both the scenarios separately here,","\n  ","\n      ","1. New Activity with selected Target Application from dropdown list","\n  ","   In our example, we can select Web-App (or any other from dropdown) Target Application from the list and then, hit the Finish button, a new ","\n         activity with the name, New - Automate Selenium Web, will be added to your business flow just below the parent activity.","\n  ","   ","\n         Figure 8","\n  ","    We can notice that the old activity has been marked as Inactive and the newly converted activity has been set as Active.","\n          ","\n      ","2. Same Activity with selected Target Application from dropdown list","\n  ","   Now, if we select Menu Item Action and will take the default Target Application as for the Target Application for selected activity from the ","\n         list and then, hit the Convert button, we will see that the newly converted Menu Item actions will be added to the same activity ","\n         i.e. 2. Create Contact - Mandatory Information.","\n  ","  ","\n       ","\n         Figure 9","\n  ","   As we can see below that the newly converted Menu Item action into UIElement actions have been added right below the source action in the same ","\n         activity. Also the source actions have been marked as Inactive and the new UIElement actions have been set as Active.","\n  ","  ","\n         Figure 10","\n  ","3. Action conversion to use the POM object","\n         As we can see below that, if we select the POM object to convert the legacy actions to use the POM object then we need to select the ","\n         Menu Item Action as in the figure below, by selecting this we can convert the selected actions to be converted to new actions which uses the ","\n         selected POM object. It tries to search the element (control in action) in the POM object and binds the new action with the element searched.","\n  ","   ","\n         Figure 11","\n  ","\n        ","\n         Figure 12","\n  ","4.    Some troubleshooting tips","\n          a)    The Actions Convertor has been tested against a number of ASCF Driver-based scenarios, with different business flows from different ","\n              projects but there could be some edge-cases, where it may encounter issues while conversion. In such cases, we advise the users to ","\n              manually configure the obsolete action causing issue like mapping of values – Locate Value, Column Number or Column Title etc. ","\n              from the old action with the new UIElement Action.","\n  ","    b)    If the users still face issues with the convertor beyond their control, they are requested to share the scenarios with the ","\n              Ginger Core Team so that they can look into it and fix it, as soon as possible to make the convertor more robust and intuitive. ","\n              Their feedback and suggestions are also welcome.","\n  ","    c)    It is recommended to choose a New Activity in Conversion Configurations section to add the newly converted actions.","\n\n"],"2":["How to use the Actions Convertor?"],"id":"103"})
